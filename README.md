### Lipo Py

A tool that is meant to help me with certain kinds of tasks that are tedious with the stock Apple Lipo.

  * recursively inspect a directory finding and displaying information about the Mach-O binaries
  * removing a slice or thinning all the binaries in an app.

It isn't meant to be beautiful - just solve small small problems
